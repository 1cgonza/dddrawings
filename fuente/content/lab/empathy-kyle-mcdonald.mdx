descriptionLong: I found McDonald's work to be unique in the way that a simple interaction seem to create a tactile experience. At the same time, the abstract render suggests to me a responsive simulation of a living system with "emotions". As the title suggests, he was aiming for "empathy". To learn how he did this, I translated the code he originally created on Processing into JavScript. All credits go to Kyle McDonald. See the original <a href="http://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/1182" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source code</a> and more of his work at <a href="http://kylemcdonald.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kylemcdonald.net</a>
