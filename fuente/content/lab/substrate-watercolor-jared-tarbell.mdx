descriptionLong: 'Another port of Processing code to JavaScript from the work by <a href="http://www.complexification.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jared Tarbell</a>. This one is a good example of visualizing a system with emerging properties. The rules it follows can be summarized to: paint "cracks" that grow in straight lines, when the crack reaches a border, stop and start new cracks somehwere else. The results are rich in complexity. See Tarbell`s <a href="http://www.complexification.net/gallery/machines/substrate/appletl/substrate_l.pde" target="_blank" rel="noopener">original code</a>.'
