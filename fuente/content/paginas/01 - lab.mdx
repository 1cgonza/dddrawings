description: A gallery of modular drawings and animations controlled by data on HTML5 Canvas / JavaScript.

This is my coding "sketchbook" for the <a href="/">Data Driven Drawings</a> project. Most of the time I am drafting concrete, singular ideas that I are part of the dissertation. This has become useful while writing because I can quickly test concepts as either web applications, animations or data visualizations. By the time I finish a sketch and go back to writing, my understanding of the issue at hand has always improved. Or I discover new material to pursue in the writing.

Also, while studying other artists, I feel the need to zoom into their work and try to understand what they are doing. Usually in an effort to advance my own coding skills I translate their work into my language of preference which is JavaScript. Same thing I do on my own drawing sketchbook when I feel the need to understand better how an artist constructs a particular image. Or when I pause an animation, frame by frame, to figure out the details of how they orchestrated a movement. In those cases, credit is given to whoever made the original work.

All the code is available on this <a href="https://github.com/1cgonza/ddd/tree/master/src/lab" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> repository.
