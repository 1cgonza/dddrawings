description: A translation of Jared Tarbell's hypnotic "Binary Ring" from Processing to JavaScript. At first I thought this might be too much for the 2d canvas renderer. Yet it seems to work just fine. I really like Tarbell's work and since he shares the <a href="http://www.complexification.net/gallery/machines/binaryRing/appletm/BinaryRing_m.pde" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source code</a>, I am going to do a few more of these to learn how he gets all those organic images. See his work at <a href="http://www.complexification.net/gallery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complexification.net</a>.
